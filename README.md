# :books: BOOKSHOP

## What is does?

ðŸ“š BOOKSHOP is an web application designed for the books lovers. The website offers to the customers an easier way to buy or rent books online. It also help the the people who want to sell the books that they don't need anymore.

## :hammer_and_wrench: How I built it?
For the backend I used PHP with MySQL and PayPal API for payments. For the design part I made a prototype of the website on Adobe XD then implemnted it with HTML and CSS.

## :crossed_swords: Challenges I ran into
I knew how to work with PHP but it was the first time when I implemented the PayPal API so I encoountered a lot of problems/bugs that took a quite long time.

## :trophy: What I learned and Accomplishments that I am proud of
- How to implement PayPal API.
- Learned new design skills/language.
